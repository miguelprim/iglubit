As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with the general laws pursuant to ยง 7 para. 1 TMG. However, according to ยง 8 to ยง 10 TMG, we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringements, we will remove the relevant content immediately.

### Liability for links

Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. If we become aware of any infringements of the law, we will remove such links immediately.

### Sales
The figures and strategies mentioned are part of our own experience. We assume no liability for any damages of any kind that a participant may suffer as a result of the implementation; the participant acts at his or her own risk.
